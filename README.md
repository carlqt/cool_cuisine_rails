# Limitations
The app is basic e-commerce with focus on CRUD on the Cart. The app doesn't have any concept of users at the moment so any actions done on the app is displayed to anyone that visits the app.

Since the app is hosted in heroku, there will be instances that the server response will take time especially when the server is asleep.

# Features!
  - Display meals
  - Add to cart
  - Remove item from cart

### Tech

Happy Shop uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

Rails 5.2
Ruby 2.5.3
jbuilder
pry-rails
money-rails
pg
faker
